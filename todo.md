# Things I would like to have

*In order of importance*

-  Way more server side error handling for paths. Also Santize I think
-  Remove all of a specific tag without doing it on each file that has it
-  Search for files that contain tag, AND, OR, NOT tags only
-  Handle delta put requests instead of re-writing the entire file
-  Select directory by dialog not by typing
