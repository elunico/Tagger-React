# Things I would like to have

*In order of importance*

-  Way more server side error handling for paths. Also Sanitize I think
  -  Definitely need to handle the case for old versioned roster.json or if there happens to be a roster.json that is not from the app
-  Remove all of a specific tag without doing it on each file that has it
-  Add ability to edit tags while recursive searching instead of only being able to view
-  Handle delta put requests instead of re-writing the entire file
-  Select directory by dialog not by typing
-  Clean up the UI especially for searching I think
